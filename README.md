# ALU-8-Bit-Processor

# Statement
Write a Verilog code and simulate 8 bit Processor which perform the following operations  (Add, Multiply, Logical operations).
# Introduction
1) ALU is the fundamental building block of the processor, which is responsible for carrying out the arithmetic and logical functions.
2) ALU comprises of combinational logic that implements:-

    ->Arithmetic Operations
    
    ->Logical Operations
    
  # Opcode and Result 
  
  000  Result = Operand1 + Operand2 (add)  
  001  Result = Operand1 - Operand2 (sub)  
  010  Result = Operand1 * Operand2 (mul)  
  011  Result = Operand1 & Operand2 (and)  
  100  Result = Operand1 | Operand2 (or)  
  101  Result = ~(Operand1 & Operand2) (nand)     
  110  Result = ~(Operand1 | Operand2) (nor)  
  111  Result = Operand1 ^ Operand2 (xor)  

# Conclusion
->The processor designed here is ALU, which is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logical operations.

->It represents the fundamental building block of CPU of a computer.

->The code successfully runs for a 8-bit input.
